## Part 1: User Stories

- As a studen who invests in stock as a hobby, I want to know how my porfolio performs everyday so I know how to make the next move.
- As a professional (whose not in finance industry), I want to know when and where to invest so that I don't make a loss due to my busy schedule.
- As a mother I want to participate actively in day trading and need a platform that can remind me when the state of a stock changes with respect to the chosen indicators, so that I can have a solid income source.
- As a retired individual, I would like to keep myself busy in stock trading by setting reminders that tell me when a stock has started soaring or dipping, so I invest my savings in stocks.
- As a college graduate who just starts working, I want to manage my savings and make savings grow as fast as I can so I can retire early.
