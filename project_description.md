# Project Background Description

Our project is based on the financial sector. It is a convenient way to know which stock to buy or sell based on some major indicators. Everyday in the morning, You'll get an email from the software about which stock to buy/sell.
We also plan to implement Neural Networks to the program and couple them with a twitter stream. We can then analyze the twitter stream to understand if the recent news is positive or negative. This paired with the indicators we can run a regression Neural Network that tells us whether to buy a particular stock or to sell it.

# Project Problem Statement
Nowadays stocks rise and fall by the nanoseconds. While it is certainly possible that previous industry experience can give insights on future performance of the stock market, it is often prone to human errors. In order to make profit from stock investment, one needs a helping hand from  computer intelligence to help make informed decision.
Our stock prediction application is designed to help people find stocks to buy or sell based on their past performances and make this process much easier and user-friendly.

# Inadequacy of current solutions to problem
Current solutions are not easily accessible to people of all backgrounds. Most of the programs are highly developed and require expert knowledge of machine learning to understand. We want our software to be simple, effective, and easy to pick up for beginners. Also, stock trading is not a familiar field to everyone so we want to deliver this simple applications to as many people from different fields and backgrounds as possible.

# Background skills/interests applicable to problem
Our group members have experience in mobile and web development. We have little experience in machine learning but we were all exposed to some basic concepts. One member in our group has done some application in stock prediction before and he believed the project is within scope for a senior design level project.

# Your project team approach to problem
We are using an open API to fetch information about the stock pricing and the stock indicator. Using this information, we are going to keep a tab on whether the index has changed from Sell to buy or vice versa. On change of status, we are going to notify the customer that they need to buy/sell a particular stock.
On a later stage we might analyze a specific twitter stream to understand whether the recent news about a company is positive or negative. Using this, and the aforementioned indicator, we will use a regression model to compute whether what we need to do with a certain stock.
