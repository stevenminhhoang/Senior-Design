# Stock Price Predictor
| Task | Assigned |
|---|---|

| 1. Research current stock prediction apps on the market and look into the technology stack being used to evaluate its pros and cons | Hoang Dao |
| 2. Research different external APIs to determine which reliable sources to collect stock information for the data set used by the application (Google Finance, ) | Hoang Dao |
| 3. Research different libraries for the LSTM Neural Networks (Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib)
| 4. Set up the infrastructure, organize the entire project in a git repository |
| 5. Import and collect stock price dataset for the neural network from the APIs | Hoang Dao |
| 6. Process the data into the Pandas Dataframe | Hoang Dao |
| 7. Develop functions for normalizing the datasets | Hoang Dao |
| 8. Design and develop the Recurrent Neural Network model prototype for the stock prediction application | Hoang Dao |
| 9. Develop the machine learning algorithm used to predict changes in stock price and constantly make changes, improvements to the algorithm | Hoang Dao |
| 10. Construct the basic Linear Regression model and the LSTM Neural Network model to capture and analyze daily stock prices | Hoang Dao |
| 11. Improve the basic LSTM model by training, documenting and comparing past performances using a set of benchmarks and evaluation metrics | Hoang Dao |
| 12. Visualize and display results by plotting actual predicted values against real-time values on the stock market per time series | Hoang Dao |
| 13. Built an iOS mobile application with a user-friendly interface to capture all the data and reports for the users to use | Hoang Dao |
| 14. Distribute the application to other people to test and validate for any bugs, feedbacks with its usabilities | Hoang Dao |
