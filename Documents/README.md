# Stock Price Predictor
Stock Price Predictor is a project on technical analysis, visualization and prediction using stock datasets from multiple sources provided by Google Finance. This project aims to utilize Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning algorithm to estimate stock prices the following day.
The model will be available to users as a command line interface that can be built and customized in order for users to interact with and try to improve the prediction results. Its performance will be measured and judged based on the difference in predicted stock price in comparison to the actual values of the targeted stock at close price on the market.

## Summary of Hours

This project took me approximately around 80 hours to complete. The majority of the time I spent was split on learning all the materials related to Machine Learning, domain knowledge and the other half on actual implementations. Besides that, I also did some research on the topic and followed the news regarding AI and the new Tensorflow 2.0 release as well as catching up with the latest technology. I was able to gain a lot of insights into the field and understand what is possible to develop within the time constraints and what not. Overall, it was an exciting learning process.
