# Project Background Description

Financial companies, large hedge funds and professionals who are invested in stock trading have long been using financial models to learn about the market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. Trying to predict the stock market by using different forecasting techniques to predict future stock values based on past returns is an interesting challenge which has attracted much of data scientists' attention recently. For me, there has always been this question if we can actually predict stock prices with machine learning?
Stock Price Predictor is the project on technical analysis, visualization and prediction using stock datasets from multiple sources provided by Google Finance. This project aims to utilize Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning algorithm to estimate stock prices the following day.
The model will be available to users as a command line interface that can be built and customized in order for users to interact with and try to improve the prediction results.
