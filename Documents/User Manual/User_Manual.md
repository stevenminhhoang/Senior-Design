## FAQ

### Is the predicted results from the model accurate and can be used by investors to yield profits?
From a practical standpoint, my project acts more as a personal project and learning achievements from studying the application of machine learning on finance rather than a complete & commercialized product. This project focuses heavily more on demonstrating how to build and train an RNN model in Tensorflow and less on solving the stock prediction problem. Thus, it can still be vastly improved and is open to further development. Right now, Machine Learning is a developing field and still requires more research in order to be applicable to business & practical uses.


### Is the application only available as a Command Line Interface (CLI) but not as a web or mobile application?
Right now, the major focus of this project is to deliver this product to software engineers & computer enthusiasts who are familiar with the command line & know how to customize building the machine learning model. In the future, more features can be added and the entire project can be ported to the Web with a Web User Interface instead.

### Would I be require to register to use this service?
The applicaion serves as just a guide to the investor and doesn't indulge in any trading. As a result, we do not ask the users to register.

### Is this development of this project completely open & free?
This project is complete open source and free to whoever is interested. All of the development tools required to implement the application are completed free and provided on the Internet, such as the Tensorflow framework supplied by Google. Other libraries and IDE tools are free to use as well including some of the machine learning libraries in Python like Keras, Numpy, Pandas. The datasets for our network models are entirely imported from the free stock APIs provided by Yahoo Finance at no cost.
