# Project Background Description

Financial companies, large hedge funds and professionals who are invested in stock trading have long been using financial models to learn about the market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. Trying to predict the stock market by using different forecasting techniques to predict future stock values based on past returns is an interesting challenge which has attracted much of data scientists' attention recently. For me, there has always been this question if we can actually predict stock prices with machine learning?
Stock Price Predictor is the project on technical analysis, visualization and prediction using stock datasets from multiple sources provided by Google Finance. This project aims to utilize Deep Learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning algorithm to estimate stock prices the following day.
The models and neural network will be incorporated in an iOS app that users can download and use on their mobile devices at any given time.

# Project Problem Statement
Because stock trading is a fairly complex and advanced fields in both finance and technology aspects, this application seeks to narrow that gap and make it easier for people to get into. This project uses a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long-Short Term Memory Networks that takes in previous stock closing prices and trading volume as inputs and visualizes the values over time to helps users predict whichever stock that yields the most profit. A basic model will be implemented using linear regression through Keras/Tensorflow library in Python. This project also makes use of NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization Libraries to analyze the datasets.

# Inadequacy of current solutions to problem
The most concurrent challenge with the existing solutions to the problem is that it is not friendly to beginners or people who have zero background in finance or technology, in particular machine learning. Most of the programs are highly developed and require extensive knowledge of machine learning to understand. In the past, there have been academic papers published using Machine Learning and Neural Networks to predict stock prices but they are not really simple and accessible to the public and require expertise in the field. Furthermore, there has not been a lot of way to simplify this process of looking at past values and prediction results for stock prices, hence an iOS application that can be downloaded to every mobile device is necessary.

# Background skills/interests applicable to problem
As a senior in Computer Science, I have had experience in building mobile application and basic knowledge in web development. I only have basic understanding of machine learning in general and have taken a relevant course in Artificial Intelligence in the last semester. However, I am really interested in this area and have strong desire in learning more about the field. I am also intending on taking a complete online course in Machine Learning next semester to supplement my understanding for this project and seek help from professor Annexstein and professor Minai, who is an expert in the Machine Learning field.

# Your project team approach to problem
For this project, I will construct a LSTM Neural Network model which is able to capture and learn from time series data of past stock prices. The historical data is taken from the opening and closing stock prices from the past years of S&P 500 companies. This model will be incorporated in the iOS app and display a friendly user interface for the users to see the data and predicted results. Its performance will be measured and judged based on the difference in predicted stock price in comparison to the actual values of the targeted stock at close price on the market. The actual implementation of this project and model might vary slightly from this project description since I have not started implementing it yet but the idea should be the same.
